# Mobile Applications I - Project 7
# TableView Novel Catalog Application

## Description
Novel Catalog is a simple TableView application designed to showcase a collection of novels along with their respective authors and publication dates. This project utilizes concepts learned in Module 6 and 7, focusing on creating a multiview application with segues for navigation, implementing a TableView for displaying data, and adhering to the MVC pattern for code organization.

## Features
1. **TableView Display**: The application features a TableView on the main ViewController displaying titles of novels along with their authors.
2. **Navigation**: Users can navigate to the BookViewController by clicking on a table cell. Segues are used for navigation between ViewControllers.
3. **Details Display**: On the BookViewController, users can view details about the selected novel, including its title, author, and publication date.
4. **MVC Pattern**: The application is refactored using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for organized code structure.

## Requirements
- Create a multiview application and use segue to navigate between ViewControllers.
- Add a TableView on the ViewController. Navigate to BookViewController on a table-cell click using segue and pass data between controllers.
- Show details about the clicked item on BookViewController.
- Refactor your application using MVC pattern.
- The application should run for all size classes, including iPads, and for the landscape orientation.

## Implementation Details
- Clone or download the project from the provided GitHub repository.
- Explore the implementation of multiview application architecture with segues for navigation.
- Examine how data is passed between ViewControllers to display details about the selected novel.
- Understand the logic behind TableView data source and delegate methods for populating data and handling user interactions.
- Learn about the MVC pattern and how it separates concerns for better maintainability.

## Usage
To use the Novel Catalog application:
1. Open the application on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Scroll through the list of novels and authors displayed in the TableView on the main screen.
3. Click on a table cell to view details about the selected novel on the BookViewController.
4. Explore the details provided, including the novel's title, author, and publication date.
5. Navigate back to the main screen to view other novels.

## Requirements
- The application is designed to run for all size classes, including iPads, and supports landscape orientation.
